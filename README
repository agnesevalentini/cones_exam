# TODO
### raceline_prediction model_v2.py
1. create a validation set to better train
2. as the paper says, each point on the waypont (normal) should be a mean of all 
the predictions done for that point, I.E if i predict a window of 9 points on 9 different
normals, each point, after 9 predictions, should be a mean of all 9 predictions over that point
3. train multiple models at the same time and pick the best one for next epoch
4. instead of testing over the whole racetrack we should also see the results just on the curves of the racetrack
5. i should give diffrent weight to the tracks depending on how badly are they doing in the training
6. test with different sizes of input and output to better represent our objective
7. test with unequal foresight and backsight, e.g. 4 in front and 12 in the back
